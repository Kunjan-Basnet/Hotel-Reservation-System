			The luxurious Resturant in Hotel Victoria offers guests a wide selection of cuisines fit for any appetite. Savor succulent Harris Ranch Black Angus Five Diamond Prime Beef at the award-winning steak house A Land Remembered. Treat your tastes to Tuscan-inspired fare at Cala Bella, our AAA Four Diamond signature Italian bistro. Or dine to your heart’s desire with an elaborate breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet at Café Osceola. Discover new dishes or delight in old favorites just an elevator ride away—or delivered to your door any time between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. And all within the beautiful setting of turn-of-the-century Spanish Revival architecture.
